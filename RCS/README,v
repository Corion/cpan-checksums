    CPAN::Checksums - Write a CHECKSUMS file for a directory as on CPAN

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Checksums qw(updatedir);
      my $success = updatedir($directory);

DESCRIPTION
    updatedir takes a directory name as argument and writes a CHECKSUMS file
    in that directory unless a previously written CHECKSUMS file is there
    that is still valid. Returns 2 if a new CHECKSUMS file has been written,
    1 if a valid CHECKSUMS file is already there, otherwise dies.
