	* running updateddir on all 4012 checksummed directories on CPAN takes a
	hell lot of time (over an hour) and slows other proceses down, so I
	wonder where the time is spent. If it were ungzip, we could lax our
	interest to only computing it for files that have a new ungzip checksum
	or so.

	mode: change-log
	change-log-default-name: "Todo"
	tab-width: 2
	left-margin: 2
